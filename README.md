# Spring Sync Ws

## Description

Fork of Spring Sync, a project created in order to enable efficient communication and data synchronization between clients and Spring server applications using a [Differential Synchronization algorithm](http://neil.fraser.name/writing/sync/eng047-fraser.pdf) created by Neil Fraser and a [JSON Patch format](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6902). 

JSON Patch defines a JSON document structure for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) document; it is suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH method. The "application/json-patch+json" media type is used to identify such patch documents.

The aim of this project is to introduce real-time WebSocket/STOMP communication between clients and the Spring Sync backend.

## Built with
* [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) - The world’s leading Java web app creation platform.
